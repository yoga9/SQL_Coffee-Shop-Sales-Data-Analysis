# SQL_Coffee-Shop-Sales-Data-Analysis

The CSV file contains a single sheet named "Transactions". The "Transactions" sheet contains the following columns:

* transaction_id: Unique ID for each transaction.
* transaction_date: Date of the transaction.
* transaction_time: Time of the transaction.
* transaction_qty: Quantity of the product sold.
* store_id: ID of the store where the transaction took place.
* store_location: Location of the store.
* product_id: ID of the product sold.
* unit_price: Price per unit of the product.
* product_category: Category of the product (e.g., Coffee, Tea).
* product_type: Type of the product (e.g., Gourmet brewed coffee).
* product_detail: Specific detail of the product (e.g., Ethiopia Rg).

I enhanced each category with deeper, more complex SQL queries that will be analysed the Coffee Shop Sales dataset in-depth. Hereâ€™s what I did for each level:

1) Basic Level: 
I added foundational insights that go beyond simple retrieval, including distinct counts, conditional filtering, and basic arithmetic on columns.

2) Intermediate Level: 
I added advanced filtering, grouping with multiple conditions, conditional aggregations, and ranking functions for detailed insights.

3) Advanced Level: 
These involve complex joins, window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and subqueries for richer, layered analysis.


Key Insights Derived:
1) Product Performance: Identified best-sellers and overperforming products within each store, along with category-level sales contributions.
2) Store Performance: Highlighted stores that perform above and below average, with insights into peak hours to optimize staffing and stock.
3) Customer Behavior: Uncovered patterns in purchase frequency and preferred shopping hours.
4) Growth Analysis: Provided month-over-month growth trends for product categories, assisting in understanding seasonal or promotional impacts.
